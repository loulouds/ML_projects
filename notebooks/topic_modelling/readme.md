### Aim
The aim of this `topic_modelling` notebook is to use text data, text mining and topic modelling to detect fraudulent behaviour.

**Using text data:**

* Types of useful text data:
    * Emails from employees and/or clients
    * Transaction descriptions
    * Employee notes
    * Insurance claim form description box
    * Recorded telephone conversations

    * Word frequencies and topic analysis
    * Style
* Word search in fraud detection for flagging suspicious words
    * Simple, straightforward and easy to explain
    * Match results can be used as a filter on top of machine learning model
    * Match results can be used as a feature in a machine learning model


### Description of the notebooks
Here we use the [Kaggle Enron Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset). It contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse.

* [00_gather_enron_emails.ipynb](00_gather_enron_emails.ipynb): Load Enron email dataset, clean it and export it into a compressed csv file.
* [01.ipynb](01.ipynb): Text mining and topic modelling [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2) in order to flag suspicious content.
